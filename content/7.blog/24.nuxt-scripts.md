The Nuxt team, in collaboration with the [Chrome Aurora](https://developer.chrome.com/aurora) team at Google, are excited to
announce the public release of Nuxt Scripts.

Nuxt Scripts provides better performance, privacy, security and developer experience for third-party scripts.

## Getting to Nuxt Scripts

Over a year ago, Daniel published the initial [Nuxt Scripts RFC](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions/22016).
The RFC proposed a module which would _allow third-party scripts to be managed and optimized, following best practices for performant and compliant websites_.

Having [personal experience](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-delay-hydration) with trying to solve performance issues related to third-party scripts, I knew how difficult these performance optimizations could be.
Nonetheless, I was keen to have a crack at the problem and took over the project.

With the RFC as the seed of the idea, I started prototyping what it could [look like](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions/22016#discussioncomment-6527001) using [Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/).

Thinking on what I wanted to build exactly, I found that the real issue wasn't just how to load "optimized" third-party scripts
but how to make working with third-party scripts a better experience overall.

## Why Build A Third-Party Script Module

[94% of sites use at least one third party](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/third-parties#prevalence) with the average site having [5 third-party providers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YqoRRsyiNsrEabVLu2nRU98JIG_0zLLuoQhC2nX8xbM/edit?gid=1428106498#gid=1428106498).

Third-party scripts are so widespread because they are fundamentally useful. We know that they aren't perfect, but they don't
need to be when solving real business problems.

They shouldn't suck to use, but they do.

### üòí Developer Experience: A fullstack headache

Let's walk through adding a third-party script to your Nuxt app using a fictional `tracker.js` script that adds a window
`track` function.

First we load in the script using the `useHead` composable. Easy.

```ts
useHead({
  scripts: [{ src: 'https://example.com/tracker.js', async: true }]
})
```

However, let's now try and get the script working in our app.

::code-group

```vue [1: Client-side only]
<script lang="ts" setup>
// ‚ùå Oops, window is not defined!
window.track('page_view', useRoute().path)
</script>
```

```vue [2: Script loading issue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
// ‚ùå Oops, script hasn't finished loading yet!
if (import.meta.client) {
  window.track('page_view', useRoute().path)
}
</script>
```

```vue [3: Broken types]
<script lang="ts" setup>
if (import.meta.client) {
  useTimeouFn(() => {
    // ‚úÖ It worked! ‚ùå But no types
    window.track('page_view', useRoute().path)
  }, 1000)
}
</script>
```

```vue [4: It works?]
<script lang="ts" setup>
declare global {
  interface Window {
    track: (e: string, p: string) => void
  }
}
if (import.meta.client) {
  useTimeouFn(() => {
    // ‚úÖ It worked! And typed 
    // ‚ùå But is this stable? 
    // ‚ùå Ad-blockers, GDPR and avoiding duplicate scripts?
    window.track('page_view', useRoute().path)
  }, 1000)
}
</script>
```

::

This ugly code should highlight some key issues:
- Everything has to be wrapped for SSR safety
- No data on the script lifecycle
- Flaky usage of the scripts API

### üêå Performance: "Why can't I get 100 on Lighthouse?"

For a visitor to start interacting with your Nuxt site, the app bundle needs to be downloaded and Vue needs to hydrate the app instance.

Loading third-party scripts can interfere with this hydration process, even when using `async` or `defer`.
This slows down the network and blocks the main thread, leading to a degraded user experience and poor [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/).

CrUX data shows Nuxt sites with numerous third-party resources typically show lower [Interaction to Next Paint (INP)](https://web.dev/articles/inp) and [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/articles/lcp) scores.

To see how quickly and easily third-parties degrade performance, we can look at the [Web Almanac 2022](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/third-parties#impact-on-performance).
The report shows that the top 10 third-party scripts  **average median blocking time is 1.4 seconds**.

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security: Do _no_ evil?

Of the top 10,000 sites, 58% of them have third parties that [exchange tracking IDs stored in external cookies](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/papers/firstparty.www21.pdf), meaning
they can track users across sites even with third-party cookies disabled.

While in many cases our hands are tied with the third parties we use, we should try and minimize the amount of data we're leaking to third-parties where possible.

Even if we have carefully reviewed our provider it can then be difficult to build a consent management system.

Additionally third-party scripts are a common attack vector for malicious actors, what can we do to mitigate this?

## What does Nuxt Scripts do about these issues?

### Composable: useScript

This composable sits between the `<script>` tag and the functionality added to `window.{thirdPartyKey}`.

For the `<script>` tag the composable:
- Gives full visibility into the script's loading and error states
- Loads scripts as Nuxt is hydrating the app by default, for slightly better performance.
- Restricts `crossorigin` and `referrerpolicy` to improve privacy and security.
- Provides a way to [delay loading the script](/docs/guides/script-triggers) until you need it.

For the scripts API it:
- Provides full type-safety around the script's functions
- Adds a proxy layer allowing your app to run when the script's functions in unsafe contexts (SSR, before the script is loaded, script is blocked)

::code-group

```ts [hello.ts]
const { greeting, $script } = useScript<{ greeting: () => void }>('/hello.js', {
  trigger: 'onNuxtReady',
  use() {
    return window.helloWorld
  }
})

// type-safe, SSR friendly
greeting() // Hello, World!

$script.then(() => {
  // script is loaded!
})
```

```ts [hello.js]
window.helloWorld = {
  greeting() {
    console.log('Hello, World!')
  }
}
```

### Script Registry

The [script registry](https://scripts.nuxt.com/scripts) is a collection of first-party integrations for common third-party scripts. As of release we support 21
scripts, with more to come.

![Nuxt Scripts Registry](/assets/blog/nuxt-scripts/registry.png){.border.border-gray-200.dark:border-gray-700.rounded-lg}

For example, we support [Google Analytics](/docs/scripts/analytics/google-analytics), [Google Tag Manager](/docs/scripts/analytics/google-tag-manager), [Facebook Pixel](/docs/scripts/ads/facebook-pixel), [Hotjar](/docs/scripts/analytics/hotjar), [Intercom](/docs/scripts/support/intercom), [Segment](/docs/scripts/analytics/segment) and more.

We also provide a number of [Facade Components](/docs/guides/facade-components) to make it easier to use these scripts in your Vue components
with maximum performance.

### Advanced script loading: Consent Management & Element event triggers

The `useScript` composable gives you full-control over how and when your scripts are loaded, by either providing a custom `trigger`
or manually calling the `$script.load()` function.

Building on top of this, Nuxt Scripts provides advanced triggers to make it even easier.
- [Consent Management](/docs/guides/consent) - Load scripts only after the user has given consent such as with a cookie banner.
- [Elemement Event Triggers](/docs/guides/script-triggers#element-event-triggers) - Load scripts based on user interactions such as scrolling, clicking, or form submissions.

```ts
const cookieConsentTrigger = useScriptTriggerConsent()
const { greeting, $script } = useScript<{ greeting: () => void }>('/hello.js', {
  // script will only loaded once the consent has been accepted
  trigger: cookieConsentTrigger
})
// ...
function acceptCookies() {
  cookieConsentTrigger.accept()
}
// greeting() is queued until the user accepts cookies
greeting()
```

### Bundling Scripts

In many cases we're loading third-party scripts from a domain that we don't control. This can lead to a number of issues:
- Privacy: The third-party script can track users across sites
- Security: The third-party script can be compromised and inject malicious code
- Performance: Extra DNS lookups will slow down the page load
- DX: Consented scripts may be blocked by ad blockers

To mitigate this, Nuxt Scripts provides a way to bundle third-party scripts into your public directory without any extra work.

```ts
useScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-confetti@latest/dist/js-confetti.browser.js', {
  bundle: true,
})
```

The script will now be served from `'/_scripts/{hash}` on your own domain.

## To be continued

As we saw, there's many opportunities to improve Third-party scripts for developers and end-users.

The initial release of Nuxt Scripts has solved _some_ of these issues, but there's still a lot of work ahead of us.

The next items on the roadmap are:
- [Add web worker support (Partytown) ](https://github.com/nuxt/scripts/issues/182)
- [More Live Chat Facade Components](https://github.com/nuxt/scripts/issues/44)
- [Offload Scripts To Nuxt Server Proxy](https://github.com/nuxt/scripts/issues/87)
- [Iframe Script Sandboxing](https://github.com/nuxt/scripts/issues/131)

We'd love to have your contribution support.
