The Nuxt team, in collaboration with the [Chrome Aurora](https://developer.chrome.com/aurora) team at Google, are excited to
announce the public release of Nuxt Scripts.

Nuxt Scripts is a better way to work with third-party scripts, providing better performance, privacy, security and developer experience.

## Getting to Nuxt Scripts

Over a year ago, Daniel published the initial [Nuxt Scripts RFC](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions/22016).
The RFC proposed a module which would "allow third-party scripts to be managed and optimized, following best practices for performant and compliant websites".

Having [personal experience](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-delay-hydration) with trying to solve performance issues related to third-party scripts, I knew how difficult these performance optimizations could be.
Nonetheless, I was keen to have a crack at the problem and took over the project.

With the RFC as the seed of the idea, I started prototyping what it could [look like](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions/22016#discussioncomment-6527001) using [Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/).

Thinking on what I wanted to build exactly, I found that the real issue wasn't just how to load "optimized" third-party scripts
but how to make working with third-party scripts a better experience overall.

## Why Build A Third-Party Script Module

[94% of sites use at least one third-party](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/third-parties#prevalence) with the average site having [5 third-party providers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YqoRRsyiNsrEabVLu2nRU98JIG_0zLLuoQhC2nX8xbM/edit?gid=1428106498#gid=1428106498).

We know that third-party scripts aren't perfect, they [slow down the web](https://web.dev/articles/optimizing-content-efficiency-loading-third-party-javascript#), cause privacy and security issues
and are a pain to work with.

However, they are fundamentally useful and aren't going anywhere soon.

By exploring the issues with third-party scripts, we can see where we can make improvements.

### üòí Developer Experience: A fullstack headache

Let's walk through adding a third-party script to your Nuxt app using a fictional `tracker.js` script that adds a window
`track` function.

First we load in the script using the `useHead` composable. Easy.

```ts
useHead({ scripts: [{ src: '/tracker.js', defer: true }] })
```

However, let's now try and get the script working in our app.

The below steps are a common pattern when working with third-party scripts in Nuxt:
- Everything has to be wrapped for SSR safety
- Flaky checks for if the script has loaded
- Augmenting the `window` object for types

::code-group

```vue [1: SSR Safety]
<script setup>
// ‚ùå Oops, window is not defined! 
// üí° The window can't be directly accessed if we use SSR in Nuxt.
// üëâ We need to make this SSR safe
window.track('page_view', useRoute().path)
</script>
```

```vue [2: Script Timing]
<script setup>
if (import.meta.client) {
  // ‚ùå Oops, script hasn't finished loading yet!
  // üí° A `defer` script may not available while our Nuxt app hydrates.
  // üëâ We need to wait for the script to be loaded
  window.track('page_view', useRoute().path)
}
</script>
```

```vue [3: Broken types]
<script lang="ts" setup>
if (import.meta.client) {
  useTimeouFn(() => {
    // ‚úÖ It's working!
    // ‚ùå Oops, types are broken.
    // üí° The `window` has strict types and nothing is defined yet.
    // üëâ We need to manually augment the window
    window.track('page_view', useRoute().path)
  }, 1000 /* should be loaded in 1 second!? */)
}
</script>
```

```vue [4: It works?]
<script lang="ts" setup>
declare global {
  interface Window {
    track: (e: string, p: string) => void
  }
}
if (import.meta.client) {
  useTimeouFn(() => {
    // ‚úÖ It's working and types are valid! 
    // ‚ùå Oops, ad-blockers, GDPR and duplicate scripts
    // üí° There's a lot of hidden complexity in third-party scripts
    // üëâ We need a better API
    window.track('page_view', useRoute().path)
  }, 1000)
}
</script>
```

### üêå Performance: "Why can't I get 100 on Lighthouse?"

For a visitor to start interacting with your Nuxt site, the app bundle needs to be downloaded and Vue needs to hydrate the app instance.

Loading third-party scripts can interfere with this hydration process, even when using `async` or `defer`.
This slows down the network and blocks the main thread, leading to a degraded user experience and poor [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/).

The [Chrome User Experience Report](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux) shows Nuxt sites with numerous third-party resources typically show poorer   [Interaction to Next Paint (INP)](https://web.dev/articles/inp) and [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/articles/lcp) scores.

To see how quickly and easily third-parties degrade performance, we can look at the [Web Almanac 2022](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/third-parties#impact-on-performance).
The report shows that the top 10 third-party scripts  **average median blocking time is 1.4 seconds**.

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security: Do _no_ evil?

Of the top 10,000 sites, 58% of them have third parties that [exchange tracking IDs stored in external cookies](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/papers/firstparty.www21.pdf), meaning
they can track users across sites even with third-party cookies disabled.

While in many cases our hands are tied with the third parties we use, we should try and minimize the amount of our end-users data that we're leaking to third-parties where possible.

When we do take on the privacy implications, it can then be difficult to accurately convey these in our privacy policies and build
the consent management required to comply with regulations such as GDPR.

Security when using third-party scripts is also a concern. Third-party scripts are common attack vectors for malicious actors, most 
do not provide `integrity` hashes for their scripts, meaning they can be compromised and inject malicious code into your app at any time.

## What does Nuxt Scripts do about these issues?

### Composable: useScript

This composable sits between the `<script>` tag and the functionality added to `window.{thirdPartyKey}`.

For the `<script>` tag the composable:
- Gives full visibility into the script's loading and error states
- Loads scripts as Nuxt is hydrating the app by default, for slightly better performance.
- Restricts `crossorigin` and `referrerpolicy` to improve privacy and security.
- Provides a way to [delay loading the script](/docs/guides/script-triggers) until you need it.

For the scripts API it:
- Provides full type-safety around the script's functions
- Adds a proxy layer allowing your app to run when the script's functions in unsafe contexts (SSR, before the script is loaded, script is blocked)

::code-group

```ts [hello.ts]
const { greeting, $script } = useScript<{ greeting: () => void }>('/hello.js', {
  trigger: 'onNuxtReady',
  use() {
    return window.helloWorld
  }
})

// ‚úÖ type-safe, SSR friendly
greeting() // Hello, World!

$script.then(() => {
  // ‚úÖ script is loaded!
})
```

```ts [hello.js]
window.helloWorld = {
  greeting() {
    console.log('Hello, World!')
  }
}
```

### Script Registry

The [script registry](https://scripts.nuxt.com/scripts) is a collection of first-party integrations for common third-party scripts. As of release we support 21
scripts, with more to come.

![Nuxt Scripts Registry](/assets/blog/nuxt-scripts/registry.png){.border.border-gray-200.dark:border-gray-700.rounded-lg}

These registry scripts are fine-tuned wrapper around `useScript` with full type-safety, runtime validation of the script options (dev only) and environment variable support

For example, we can look at the [Fathom Analytics](https://scripts.nuxt.com/scripts/analytics/fathom-analytics) script.

```ts
const fathom = useScriptFathomAnalytics({
  // ‚úÖ options are validated at runtime
  site: undefined
})
// ‚úÖ typed
fathom.trackPageview()
```

The registry includes several [Facade Components](https://scripts.nuxt.com/docs/guides/facade-components), such as
[Google Maps](https://scripts.nuxt.com/scripts/content/google-maps), [YouTube](https://scripts.nuxt.com/scripts/content/youtube-player) and [Intercom](https://scripts.nuxt.com/scripts/support/intercom).

Facade components are "fake" components that get hydrated when the third-party script when the script is loaded. Facade components
have trade-offs but can drastically improve your performance. See the [What are Facade Components?](https://scripts.nuxt.com/docs/guides/facade-components#what-are-facade-components)
guide for more information.

### Advanced script loading: Consent Management & Element event triggers

The `useScript` composable gives you full-control over how and when your scripts are loaded, by either providing a custom `trigger`
or manually calling the `$script.load()` function.

Building on top of this, Nuxt Scripts provides advanced triggers to make it even easier.
- [Consent Management](/docs/guides/consent) - Load scripts only after the user has given consent such as with a cookie banner.
- [Element Event Triggers](/docs/guides/script-triggers#element-event-triggers) - Load scripts based on user interactions such as scrolling, clicking, or form submissions.

```ts
const cookieConsentTrigger = useScriptTriggerConsent()
const { greeting, $script } = useScript<{ greeting: () => void }>('/hello.js', {
  // script will only loaded once the consent has been accepted
  trigger: cookieConsentTrigger
})
// ...
function acceptCookies() {
  cookieConsentTrigger.accept()
}
// greeting() is queued until the user accepts cookies
greeting()
```

### Bundling Scripts

In many cases we're loading third-party scripts from a domain that we don't control. This can lead to a number of issues:
- Privacy: The third-party script can track users across sites
- Security: The third-party script can be compromised and inject malicious code
- Performance: Extra DNS lookups will slow down the page load
- DX: Consented scripts may be blocked by ad blockers

To mitigate this, Nuxt Scripts provides a way to bundle third-party scripts into your public directory without any extra work.

```ts
useScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-confetti@latest/dist/js-confetti.browser.js', {
  bundle: true,
})
```

The script will now be served from `'/_scripts/{hash}` on your own domain.

## To be continued

As we saw, there's many opportunities to improve third-party scripts for developers and end-users.

The initial release of Nuxt Scripts has solved _some_ of these issues, but there's still a lot of work ahead of us.

The next items on the roadmap are:
- [Add web worker support (Partytown) ](https://github.com/nuxt/scripts/issues/182)
- [More Live Chat Facade Components](https://github.com/nuxt/scripts/issues/44)
- [Offload Scripts To Nuxt Server Proxy](https://github.com/nuxt/scripts/issues/87)
- [Iframe Script Sandboxing](https://github.com/nuxt/scripts/issues/131)

We'd love to have your contribution support.
